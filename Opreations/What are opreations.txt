Arithmetic Operators:

    + (Addition): Adds two operands.
    - (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
    * (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.
    / (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
    % (Modulus): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
    ** (Exponentiation): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
    // (Floor Division): Returns the quotient of the division, discarding the remainder.

Comparison Operators:

    == (Equal to): True if the operands are equal.
    != (Not equal to): True if the operands are not equal.
    < (Less than): True if the left operand is less than the right operand.
    > (Greater than): True if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
    <= (Less than or equal to): True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
    >= (Greater than or equal to): True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Logical Operators:

    and (Logical AND): True if both operands are true.
    or (Logical OR): True if at least one operand is true.
    not (Logical NOT): True if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true.

Assignment Operators:

    = (Assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
    += (Add and Assign): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    -= (Subtract and Assign): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    *= (Multiply and Assign): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    /= (Divide and Assign): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    %= (Modulus and Assign): Takes the modulus of the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    **= (Exponentiate and Assign): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    //= (Floor Divide and Assign): Performs floor division on the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

These operators play a crucial role in performing various operations in Python programs.
